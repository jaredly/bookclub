# Exclusive Virtual Book Club
(TODO come up with a pithier name)

In general, Social Networksâ„¢ of the internet age are addicted to growth, and as such, require network effects - the larger the better. The more people there are, and the more they are connected to each other, the better / more engaging it is, and the better it looks for attracting VC money.

I would rather have fewer, stronger connections; a network where we share things that are important, and have real dialogue.

This is my first attempt at such a network.

The idea is this:
- you create a "book group", with a title, and seed it with some books you'd like to discuss with this group. You then share an invite link to the group with the set of friends you'd like to discuss these books with. It makes most sense to have separate book groups for the separate spheres of your life; for example, work, church, neighborhood; so that the people in the group already have existing connections on which to build.
- some of those people join the group, vote on books already listed or add their own, and indicate availability.
- Once critical mass has been reached (you can set the number, but somewhere between 4 and 10 is probably good), the book group is scheduled! And then you get together (in person or virtually) to discuss the book.
- there's also a discussion-board feature where you can talk about the books (or anything else) asynchronously, or post questions or discussion topics in preparation for a meeting.
